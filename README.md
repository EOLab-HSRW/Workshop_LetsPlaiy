# Workshop_Gymnasium

## Overview
The main goal of this workshop is to introduce students at a gymnasium level to embedded programming and AI-based solutions using the micro:bit board. This workshop aims to provide a foundational understanding of embedded systems in a basic and abstract manner.

## Hardware and Environment
We will be using the micro:bit board, which supports various functionalities such as BLE communication, temperature sensing, gyroscope, light intensity measurement, and distance measurement. The programming environment chosen for this workshop is Microsoft MakeCode.

## Sketch Ideas
The workshop includes the following 5 sketch ideas:
1. **Basic Robot**: Control movement (forward, backward, left, right).
2. **Plant Monitoring**: Use moisture sensor and servo for automated watering.
3. **Reaction Sensing Game**: Button-based game to test reaction times.
4. **Ultrasonic Distance Sensor**: Measure distances to obstacles.
5. **Basic Game**: Implement a game of rock-paper-scissors with randomization.
